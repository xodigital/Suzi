<!--
	Grid behavior is specified with the following classes on .grid__item(s)
	
	.width-PercentN - The width of the .grid__item in percent for all breakpoints.
		.e.g. .width-50

	.at_PxBreakpoint-width-PercentN_at - The width of the .grid__item in percent at the specifed px breakpoint.
		e.g. .at_600-width-33
	
	Grids are not limited to divs. Can be used on lists etc

	Important note: Because grids use inline-block, the white space must be stripped out between each .grid__item. If using Twig, wrap the whole .grid in a spaceless tag.
